    <p>Concrete – which was originally used within the Roman Empire – was improved with the invention of portland cement in the early 1800s, and replaced stone and masonry as the primary material for bridge foundations. When iron or steel is embedded in the concrete, as in reinforced concrete or prestressed concrete, it is a strong, inexpensive material that can be used for horizontal elements of beam bridges and box girder bridges.[34]

Straight, diagonal cables – known as "stays" – can be used to directly connect the bridge deck to bridge towers.[35] Stays were used as supplemental supports in some suspension bridges in the 19th century – including the Brooklyn Bridge.[36] Cable-stayed bridges – which used cable-stays as the exclusive means of support – became a popular bridge design following World War II.[37][e]</p>
