    <p>he earliest forms of bridges were simple structures used to cross swamps and creeks, consisting of wooden boardwalks or logs.[2][a] Pilings – which are critical elements of bridge construction – were used in Switzerland around 4,000 BC to support houses built over water.[4]

Several corbel arch bridges were built c. 13th century BC by the Mycenaean Greece culture, including the Arkadiko Bridge, which is still in existence.[5] In the 7th century BC, Sennacherib constructed stone aqueducts to carry water near the city of Ninevah.[6] One of these aqueducts crossed a small valley at Jerwan with five corbelled arches, and was 280 meters (920 ft) long and 20 meters (66 ft) wide.[6] In Babylonia in 626 BC, a bridge across the Euphrates was built with an estimated length of 120 to 200 meters (390 to 660 ft).[7] In India, the Arthashastra treatise by Kautilya mentions the construction of dams and bridges.[8] Ancient China has an extensive history of bridge construction, including cantilever bridges, rope bridges, and bridges built across floating boats.[9]</p>
