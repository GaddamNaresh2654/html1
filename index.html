            <td><p>A bridge is a structure built to span physical obstacles such as rivers, lakes, roads, railways, ravines, or other geographic or artificial barriers. Its primary purpose is to provide passage over the obstacle, facilitating the movement of automobiles, trains, and pedestrians, but it may also accommodate pipelines, utility lines, buildings, wildlife crossings, and even canals,client or governmental preferences, and the experience and capabilities of the construction team. To address these complex demands, engineers employ methodologies such as Limit State Design, which ensures that bridges remain functional under both normal and extreme conditions.</p></td>

            <td><p>The history of bridge building reflects the evolution of engineering knowledge, materials, and construction techniques across different civilizations and eras. The Roman and Chinese civilizations were renowned for their advanced engineering techniques, and some of the bridges they built are still standing, including the 1st century Roman Pont du Gard and the 7th century Chinese Anji Bridge. The Renaissance, in 15th–16th century Europe, brought a new emphasis on science and engineering, leading to stronger bridges with longer spans. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, iron became an important construction material for bridges. </p></td>

            <td><p>The designer of a bridge must address a wide range of functional, structural, environmental, and aesthetic requirements to ensure safety, efficiency, and durability. Fundamental requirements include structural strength, stability, and the capacity to provide safe passage for users. In addition to these core functions, designers must consider factors such as cost, aesthetics, expected lifespan, the time frame for construction, client or governmental preferences, and the experience and capabilities of the construction team. To address these complex demands, engineers employ methodologies such as Limit State Design, which ensures that bridges remain functional under both normal and extreme conditions. The finite element analysis method enables detailed modeling of stresses and deformations within the structure.</p></td>
