            <td><p>A bridge is a structure built to span physical obstacles such as rivers, lakes, roads, railways, ravines, or other geographic or artificial barriers. Its primary purpose is to provide passage over the obstacle, facilitating the movement of automobiles, trains, and pedestrians, but it may also accommodate pipelines, utility lines, buildings, wildlife crossings, and even canals,client or governmental preferences, and the experience and capabilities of the construction team. To address these complex demands, engineers employ methodologies such as Limit State Design, which ensures that bridges remain functional under both normal and extreme conditions.</p></td>

The Roman and Chinese civilizations were renowned for their advanced engineering techniques, and some of the bridges they built are still standing, including the 1st century Roman Pont du Gard and the 7th century Chinese Anji Bridge. The Renaissance, in 15th–16th century Europe, brought a new emphasis on science and engineering, leading to stronger bridges with longer spans. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, iron became an important construction material for bridges. </p></td>

            <td><p>The designer of a bridge must address a wide range of functional, structural, environmental, and aesthetic requirements to ensure safety, efficiency, and durability. Fundamental requirements include structural strength, stability, and the capacity to provide safe passage for users. In addition to these core functions, designers must consider factors such as cost, aesthetics, expected lifespan, the time frame for construction, client or governmental preferences, and the experience and capabilities of the construction team. To address these complex demands, engineers employ methodologies such as Limit State Design, which ensures that bridges remain functional under both normal and extreme conditions. The finite element analysis method enables detailed modeling of stresses and deformations within the structure.</p></td>

        <p>There are a variety of terms that describe long, multi-span bridges – including raised bridge, viaduct, trestle, and causeway. The usage of the terms can overlap, but each has a specific focus.[100] Viaducts (carrying vehicles) and aqueducts (carrying water) are bridges crossing a valley, supported by multiple arches or piers.[101] Romans built many aqueducts, some of which are still standing today.[102] Notable viaducts include Penponds Viaduct in England,[103] Garabit Viaduct in France,[104] Tunkhannock Viaduct in Pennsylvania,[105] and Millau Viaduct in France.[99]
A trestle consists of multiple short spans supported by closely spaced structural elements. A trestle is similar to a viaduct, but viaducts typically have taller piers and longer spans.[106] A continuous truss bridge is a long, single truss that rests upon multiple supports. A continuous truss bridge may use less material than a series of simple trusses because a continuous truss distributes live loads across all the spans (in contrast to a series of distinct trusses, where each truss must be capable of supporting the entire live load). Visually, a continuous truss looks similar to a cantilever bridge, but a continuous truss experiences hogging stresses at the supports and sagging stresses between the supports.[107] A causeway is a raised road, usually built over a lake or other body of water.[108] Some causeways are bridges, such as the 38.4 km Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana;[85] but many – such as the King Fahd Causeway in Saudi Arabia – are partially or entirely built on solid dirt or rock embankments.[109]</p>
